SObjectizer is a framework for agent-oriented programming in C++. From one
side, SObjectizer is a set of rules and principles for designing programms in
agent-oriented style. On other side SObjectizer provides set of C++ classes for
implementing agents.

Obtaining and building
======================

Building via Mxx_ru
===================

NOTE. This is a standard way for building SObjectizer. This way is used in
SObjectizer development process.

To build SObjectizer it is necessary to use Ruby language and Mxx_ru tool.
Install Ruby and then install Mxx_ru via RubyGems command:

> gem install Mxx_ru

SObjectizer can be obtained from Subversion repository on SourceForge:

> svn export http://svn.code.sf.net/p/sobjectizer/repo/tags/so_5/5.5.2 so-5.5.2

To build SObjectizer:

> cd so-5.5.2/dev
> ruby build.rb

Or to build SObjectizer with all tests and samples:

> cd so-5.5.2/dev
> ruby build_all.rb

To build html-format documentation for SObjectizer the Doxygen tool is
necessary. If it is installed then:

> cd so-5.5.2/doxygen
> doxygen

Generated html-files will be located in so-5.5.2/dev/doc/html.

Building via CMake
==================

NOTE. This way of building is not used by SObjectizer developers. The projects
files for CMake are contributed by users.

To build SObjectizer via CMake it is necessary to have CMake and some knowledge
of how to use it. The following action is just a demonstration:

SObjectizer can be obtained from Subversion repository on SourceForge:

> svn export http://svn.code.sf.net/p/sobjectizer/repo/tags/so_5/5.5.2 so-5.5.2

To build SObjectizer under Linux:

> cd so-5.5.2
> mkdir cmake_build
> cd cmake_build
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./ ../dev
> make
> make install

Those commands will create all necessary Makefile, then build SObjectizer and
samples (building and runing tests via CMake is not supported in v.5.5.2), then
copy all executables to 'bin' subdir and shared library to 'lib' subdir.

To build SObjectizer under Windows by MS Visual Studio 2013 from command line:

> cd so-5.5.2
> mkdir cmake_build
> cd cmake_build
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./ -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" ../dev
> msbuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release Project.sln
> msbuild /t:Build /p:Configuration=Release INSTALL.vcxproj
